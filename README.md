# Answer the Questions

## What is GraphQL?

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## How is GraphQL different from REST?

- The main difference is being able to establish a single endpoint to make the requests and thus obtain only the necessary information.

## What are the main components of a GraphQL query?

- Operation: Specifies the type of operation to perform on the GraphQL server. It can be a query (query), a mutation (mutation) or a subscription (subscription).

- Fields: Specify the data that you want to retrieve from the GraphQL server. The fields are organized in a tree structure, allowing you to specify exactly what data should be retrieved.

- Arguments – Allows you to provide additional information to the GraphQL server to filter or modify the data that is returned. The arguments are specified next to the corresponding fields in the query.

- Aliases: used to rename the fields in the response. This can be useful if multiple fields with the same name are requested and you want to distinguish between them in the response.

- Variables: allow you to parameterize a query and pass dynamic values to the GraphQL server. Variables are defined in the query and passed as arguments at run time.

- Directives: allow you to modify the behavior of a query or mutation at run time. For example, the @include directive is used to include a field in the response only if a certain condition is met.

## What is a GraphQL schema?

- The Query, Mutation, and Subscription types are the entry points for the requests sent by the client. To enable the allPersons-query that we saw before, the Query type would have to be written as follows:

## What is a resolver in GraphQL?

- In GraphQL, a resolver is a function that is responsible for resolving the value of a field in a GraphQL query. When a client makes a GraphQL query, the server processes the query by resolving each field to its corresponding value. A resolver is the code that knows how to fetch or calculate the value for a given field.

Each field in a GraphQL query can have its own resolver, and resolvers can be written in any programming language. Resolvers are typically defined as part of a GraphQL schema and are associated with a specific field by name.

Resolvers can be simple or complex, depending on the data source and the logic required to fetch or calculate the value for a given field. For example, a simple resolver for a field that maps directly to a database column might just return the value of that column. A more complex resolver might need to make multiple database queries or call external APIs to calculate the value of a field.

## How can you perform mutations in GraphQL?

- Writing Data with Mutations
Next to requesting information from a server, the majority of applications also need some way of making changes to the data that’s currently stored in the backend. With GraphQL, these changes are made using so-called mutations. There generally are three kinds of mutations:

creating new data
updating existing data
deleting existing data
Mutations follow the same syntactical structure as queries, but they always need to start with the mutation keyword. 

## How does GraphQL handle errors?

- GraphQL provides a standardized way of handling errors that occur during query execution. When an error occurs during query execution, GraphQL responds with a JSON object that includes an "errors" key. The value of this key is an array of error objects, where each error object provides information about the error.

Each error object typically includes a "message" field that describes the error, as well as optional fields like "locations" and "path" that provide additional context about where the error occurred in the query.

## Can you use GraphQL with any programming language?

- Yes, GraphQL can be used with any programming language that can make HTTP requests and parse JSON. This is because GraphQL is language-agnostic, which means that it is not tied to any specific programming language or technology.

## What is the main problem that solves graphql and how is it solved?

- The main problem that GraphQL solves is the inefficiency and complexity of traditional REST APIs when it comes to fetching and manipulating data. REST APIs require clients to make multiple requests to fetch data from different endpoints, which can result in over-fetching or under-fetching of data. This can lead to slow response times, network congestion, and inefficient use of server resources.

GraphQL solves this problem by providing a more efficient and flexible way of querying and mutating data. Instead of making multiple requests to different endpoints, clients can use a single GraphQL query to specify exactly what data they need and how it should be formatted. This allows servers to optimize the data fetching process, resulting in faster response times and more efficient use of server resources.
